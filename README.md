# Lebron-Troll-Dash

##LeBron Troll Dash is a groundbreaking breakthrough of AI creativity: featuring the collecting of memes, jumping over obstacles, fighting your classmate, multiple character select, dark mode toggle, and stellar background music with a much needed mute button! The genius muses Anna Moore and Genesis Ijeomah thought up the masterpiece of this game, using prompt engineering skills to fine-tune the ChatGPT output of the code. Genesis came up with the idea of jumping over obstacles, putting in Mr. Gardner multiple character select, and putting text on the screen for messages. Anna came up with Lebron collecting memes, inputting the individual pictures, fighting Genesis, and music selection. However, the majority of the ideas were a combination of our super genius intellect bouncing off and building on each other. After iterating at least 21 times and testing all the different versions, we now have a game that is built upon HTML, Javascript, and CSS and was executed through a text editor and file explorer.
